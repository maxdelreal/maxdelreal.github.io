### CPSC 120

* Lab 1

    Lab 1, part 1 was a favorte of mine because, prior to entering the class, I had wanted to learn how to use git. However, online resources were not very helpful as they seemed to cover too much information. Lab 1 showed me that what I had wanted to learn was as simple as "add, commit, push".

* Lab 5

    I appreciated Lab 5 because of the practice it gave me in learning how to use if statements in c++. While I had had some experience with if-else statements in pyhton I was uncertain of how they would work in c++. This lab instilled a sense of confidence and competence in me that made the rest of the semester feel a bit easier. 

* Lab 6

    Similarly to lab 5, lab 6 waas hlepful to me because of the practice it gave me with using loops in a language I was not yet familiar with. Although I had some understanding of loops due to my previous experience in python, I had not utilized them very often or in any major way. This made this lab very helpful to my learning of c++ and of loops as a general concept in computer science.
